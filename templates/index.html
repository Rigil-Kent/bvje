      <p>The Baltimore Vocal Jazz Ensemble is a unique group of vocalists dedicated to providing a capella entertainment in  an eclectic variety of styes in a wide range of venues.  Under the direction of Joe Mannherz, members travel from all over the mid-Atlantic region to sing ballads and swing from the 40's to contemporary jazz and pop of the present. From  "Basie and Cole" to the "Beatles and Billy Joel", the ensemble has entertained audiences at Longwood Gardens in Pa. to the State House in Annapolis; from private birthday parties and weddings to "Bill Gates" at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC.
